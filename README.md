# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [ Interactive card details form coding challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw). 
But I also change it a little bit because I'm learning JS and I needed it to use as an excercise for what I learned.
This solution was made with HTML, CSS and JS VANILLA.

## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this interactive card details form and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to: 

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

Also I added some challenges:
- Save in a local storage the cards you added.
- Can choose the card you want to see the details.
